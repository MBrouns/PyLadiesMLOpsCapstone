# Readme

Pytown, located in the remote area in the north of the Netherlands, wants to live on 100% renewable energy. Our town has enough solar panels and wind turbines to generate electricity, so we disconnected from the main electricity grid a while ago. However, we usually do not use the electricity at the moment of its generation by sun and/or wind, which is causing daily power blackouts. We are fed up with all the electricity problems and ask your team to support us. Help us to adjust our electricity demand to the electricity generation.

We want to have a dashboard telling us when it is allowed to use electricity as much as we want, use less electricity or charge only essential devices.
