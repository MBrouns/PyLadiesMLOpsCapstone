# Feedback

Hereby my feedback for your repository. Congratulations on having participated in the bootcamp and on your efforts to 
complete it. Your code is clean and clear, as well as your presentation slides.

## General

- Why is there no _requirements.txt_ or Conda environment file in the root directory?

- It is usually best to not save data in a code repository. If you are aware of this and
have it here due to limitations on storage, then please disregard this comment. Otherwise, you
could consider a storage solution from Azure.

- In the _readme.md_, add instructions for usage.

- Not everyone appreciates expletives or you may have to work alongside people with certain religious beliefs, so I suggest to not use phrases that may be offensive to some in professional environments. Perhaps something like _Heck Yeah!_ or similar still expresses your enthousiasm for free and open source software. There is also _tartar sauce!_ instead of...hopefully you get the point :)

## Specific Files

Hereby feedback on some files.

### MLOps Bootcamp.pdf

- Good structure overall and each slide is also clear. Congratulations!

- There seems to be a very large difference between _Predicted Energy Consumption_ and _Total Energy Generated_. Could this be due to an error in the code or diagram? If it is correct, please disregard this comment.

- I would rename the slide _Classification_ to another word, such as _Business rules_. Since you are presenting machine learning models, at least my mind immediately thought of classification algorithms.
